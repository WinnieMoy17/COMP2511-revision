Code Smells
- follow method -- deep nested for loops and if statements
- violation of srp

- refused bequest
- duplicated Code
- excessive coupling
- lack of encapsulation

encapsulate follow method -> make it into a follow person method in the person class

Methods such as follow person, getPopularity, should all be done within the person class, as it concerns one person
This makes the code more encapsulated and looser coupled.

The waste book controller is also doing too much -- split off the responsibilities into another class maybe

-> introducing a social network class that centralises the management of people, reducing responsibilites from weate book controller.
